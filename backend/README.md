# Backend - Trivia on Pi API

## Setting up the Backend

### Install Dependencies

1. **Python 3.7** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

2. **Virtual Environment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Key Pip Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use to handle the lightweight SQL database. You'll primarily work in `app.py`and can reference `models.py`.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross-origin requests from our frontend server.

### Set up the Database

With Postgres running, create a `trivia` database:

```bash
createbd trivia
```

Populate the database using the `trivia.psql` file provided. From the `backend` folder in terminal run:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

### Run the Server

From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

## API Reference

### Getting Started
- Base URL: Currently the app can only be run locally and is not hosted at a base URL. The default backend host address is `127.0.0.1:5000`
- Authentication: Currently the API does not require authentication of API keys.

### Error Handling
The API will return these errors when request fails:
- 404: Resource could not be found
- 405: Method not allowed
- 422: Unprocessable
- 500: Internal Server Error

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": 404,
    "message": "resource could not be found"
}
```
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": 405,
    "message": "method not allowed"
}
```
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": 422,
    "message": "unprocessable"
}
```
```json

    "success": false,
    "error": 500,
    "message": "internal server error"
}
```
